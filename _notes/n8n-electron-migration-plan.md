# n8n Project Analysis & Electron Migration Plan

## Project Overview
n8n is a workflow automation platform built with a modular architecture. The project uses a monorepo structure managed with pnpm workspaces, containing multiple packages:

### Core Components
- `packages/core`: Core components for n8n
- `packages/workflow`: Base workflow code
- `packages/cli`: Command-line interface
- `packages/editor-ui`: Vue.js-based UI for workflow creation/editing
- `packages/design-system`: Component system using Storybook
- `packages/nodes-base`: Default nodes included in n8n

### Additional Components
- `packages/@n8n/chat`: Chat functionality
- `packages/@n8n/api-types`: Types for internal API
- `packages/@n8n/benchmark`: Benchmarking tools
- `packages/@n8n/codemirror-lang`: CodeMirror language support
- `packages/@n8n/nodes-langchain`: LangChain integration nodes
- `packages/@n8n/json-schema-to-zod`: JSON schema conversion utilities

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3.5+ based UI (packages/editor-ui)
- **Backend**: Node.js based server
- **Package Management**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Current Deployment**: Docker-based containerization
- **Build Tools**:
  - Vite 6.0+
  - TypeScript
  - Vue-tsc for type checking
  - Vitest for testing

## Dependencies Overview
Key frontend dependencies (from pnpm-workspace.yaml):
- Vue 3.5+
- Vue Router 4.5+
- Vite 6.0+
- Vitest for testing
- Sentry integration
- Various UI components and utilities

## Current Deployment Strategy
Currently, n8n is designed to run in Docker containers, which provides:
- Isolated runtime environment
- Easy dependency management
- Consistent deployment across platforms
- Built-in networking capabilities
- Database integration support

## Challenges for Electron Migration

### 1. Architecture Adaptation
- Need to transition from container-based to desktop-based architecture
- Must handle process management differently than in Docker
- Database persistence strategy needs to be reworked
- Network handling needs to be adapted for desktop environment

### 2. Backend Services
- Current backend services need to be adapted to run as local processes
- Database connections need to be managed locally
- File system access patterns need to be adjusted
- Service discovery and communication needs redesign

### 3. Frontend Considerations
- Current Vue.js frontend can be maintained but needs adaptation for Electron
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) needs to be implemented
- Window management needs to be added
- Native OS integration points need to be identified

### 4. Development Workflow
- Build process needs to be adapted for Electron
- Development environment setup needs modification
- Testing strategy needs to be updated
- Deployment process needs complete redesign

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Set up basic Electron project structure
   - Define main and renderer process architecture
   - Plan IPC communication strategy

2. **Backend Migration**
   - Identify core services that need to run locally
   - Plan database strategy (SQLite vs alternatives)
   - Design service startup/shutdown flow

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Adapt Vue.js frontend for Electron
   - Implement window management
   - Add native OS integration points

4. **Development Infrastructure**
   - Set up build pipeline
   - Configure development environment
   - Plan testing strategy

5. **Deployment Planning**
   - Design update mechanism
   - Plan installation process
   - Consider platform-specific requirements

## Open Questions

1. Database Strategy
   - Which database to use for local storage?
   - How to handle migrations?
   - Data backup/restore strategy?

2. Process Management
   - How to manage background processes?
   - Service discovery mechanism?
   - Error handling and recovery?

3. Security Considerations
   - How to handle authentication locally?
   - Secure storage of credentials?
   - Network security for local services?

4. Performance
   - Resource usage optimization
   - Startup time optimization
   - Background process management

## Next Actions
1. Create proof-of-concept Electron shell
2. Test basic Vue.js integration
3. Implement simple IPC communication
4. Test database integration
5. Create development environment setup

This document will be updated as we progress with the migration planning and implementation.
